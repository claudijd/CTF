# Background

User is asked to visit:

nc 128.238.66.212 31337

User is also provided the following files:

exploit1
exploit1.c

# Notes

Running exploit1 in VM suggests exploit1 is the server at 31337

exploit1.c shows a vulnerable function that reads 1020 bytes of
a 1016 byte buffer.

This means all we need to do is just overrun the buffer with at
minimum 1017 bytes and we'll get the flag, which resumably is
stored server side in the "./key" file.

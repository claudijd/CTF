# Background

User is asked to visit:

nc 128.238.66.212 31337

User is also provided the following files:

exploit1
exploit1.c

# Notes

Running exploit1 in VM suggests exploit1 is the server at 31337

exploit1.c shows a vulnerable function that reads 1020 bytes of
a 1016 byte buffer. Next we have a conditional with backdoor as
the only requirement.  If backdoor is set to non-zero the key
should be returned.

All we need to do is overrun the buffer with at minimum 1017 
bytes and we should get the flag, which presumably is stored 
server side in the "./key" file.

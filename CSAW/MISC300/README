Lessons Learned:

1.) Board boundaries don't wrap pac man style
2.) Too many \n's will cause server to choke on Round 2
    - this was a common issue experienced by many mentioned in IRC (including myself)
3.) You can make pretty animations with the board class

Solution:

1.) Parse the seed board from the wire
2.) Advance the board X generations into the future
3.) Write the new board to the wire (be careful not to send too many new lines)
4.) Repeat steps until you have successfully completed 100 rounds of play
5.) Read your congrats and key from the wire to solve
